## Time Series Forcasting with TensorFlow.js

Pull stock prices from online API and perform predictions using Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with TensorFlow.js framework

As changes in stocks prices on the market are dynamic and affected by multiple factors, which is typically unpredictable, this service is by no means a trading prediction tool. This site demonstrates time series forecasting to predict future values based on historical data from the past.

In this site, I will use Recurrent Neural Network predict simple moving average. You can either begin by scrolling down each step or hit the Load Demo button.
