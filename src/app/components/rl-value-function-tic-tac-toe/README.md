## Reinforcement Learning Value Function with Tic Tac Toe

A simple reinforcement learning algorithm for agents to learn the game tic-tac-toe. This demonstrate the purpose of the value function.

Train the agent to play tic-tac-toe, by having 2 agents play against each other through simulation. You can experiment by adjusting 2 parameters, 1) learning rate and 2) probability of exploration of each agent.

After training, you can play against the agent.
