Staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was great! Great location and great value for money. Didn't want to leave!\nEtt mycket bra hotell. Det som drog ner betyget var att vi fick ett rum under taksarna dr det endast var full sthjd i 80 av rummets yta.\nWe stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.\nWe stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful.

From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!\nLovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Staff were welcoming and helpful.\nottimo soggiorno e ottima sistemazione nei giorni frenetici di inaugurazione della Biennale. Le signore alla reception sono efficientissime e squisite e non sono da meno le ragazze che servono la prima colazione. Da tornarci\nGnstiger Ausgangspunkt fr Venedig Besuche. Ruhige Lage auf dem Lido. Flugplatz Lido und Bootsanlegestellen fulufig erreichbar. Zimmer ziemlich eng, aber alles vorhanden. Frhstck fr Italien ausgesprochen reichhaltig.

The room was clean and comfortable. My wife and I had a room with a terrace over looking the water...it was a great view! I will look to stay at this hotel my next time in Venice...very pleased.\nNice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone.\nWir hatten leider Pech mit unserem Zimmer,war in einem winzigen Hof, sehr hellhrig. Personal war sehr nett, Frhstck sehr gut.\nHotellihuone oli ullakolla, jossa ei pystynyt kvelemn suorassa. Huonekorkeus oli suurimmassa osassa n. 1,5m. Huoneestamme varastettiin rannekoru ja neuletakki. Lisksi Spa ei ollut hotellissa vaan n. kilometrin pss toisessa hotellissa. Laivalaiturilta oli kilometrin matka hotelliin. Lidon saari on kyll hyv majoituspaikka kun vierailee Venetsiassa, mutta en suosittele tt hotellia.\nDON'T stay here unless you're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.\nWe had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.\nWir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern. Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle. Wir fuhren allerdings nie mit dem Bus, da der Weg zum Anleger fr die Wasserbusse nicht weit war. Das Warten auf den nchsten Bus htte mitunter lnger gedauert, als zu Fu zu dem Anleger zu gehen.\nLovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes.\nDas Hotel liegt auf der Insel Lido neben Venedig, direkt am Meer mit Blick auf Venedig. Lido kann man sehr gut mit den Booten erreichen. Vom Bootsanlegeplatz sind es ca. 400 m zum Hotel an der Kste entlang. Den Weg mussten wir zu Fu zurcklegen, da keine Busse wegen einer Baustelle dorthin fahren. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen, berhaupt war das Personal im Hotel sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war gemtlich eingerichtet, das Bad relativ gro und alles sehr sauber und ordentlich. Auch mit dem Frhstcksbffet waren wir sehr zufrieden - gute Qualitt und relativ groe Auswahl. Wir waren rundherum zufrieden und wrden das Hotel sofort wieder buchen.\nLocated on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!\nMysigt med fina rum, bra frukost och nra bde till stranden och btterminalen.\nHotel ist sehr gut , wir waren zum zweiten mal in diesem Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich. Einzig was zu bemengeln ist Fernsehen kann man nur zwei Programe, aber das ist im Urlaub nicht so wichtig.\nWir hatten ein Zimmer mit Balkon und Blick auf die Lagune - wunderschn!!!\nGreat stay...close to ferry.food not so good nearby\nStayed with parents, wife twin toddlers in two triple rooms. The hotel is easy to reach and the rooms were well placed well furnished. The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace.\nNous avons pass 4 jours dans cet htel situ 5 mn pieds des des vaporetto. Le personnel est trs sympa parle franais. Toujours l pour donner de bons conseils sur les restaurants ou les visites. Rien redire. Tout tait bien. Chambres petit djeuner et environnement.\nThis hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.\nIt was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice\nRoom was tiny-bed saggy-bAthroom door didn't work. Good breakfast and convenient location. Wouldn't return or recommend.\nHtel trs bien situ dans un coin calme loin de l'agitation frntique du centre de Venise, mais seulement quelques minutes de bateau. Les chambres conomiques sous toit ne sont pas trs ergonomiques cause de la pente de toit et il fait vite chaud s'il y a du soleil lorsque l'air conditionn ne fonctionne pas encore, comme lors des congs de Pques. La vue extrieure se limite aux velux. La TV n'est pas un cran plat. On s'attend un peu plus de luxe dans un 4 toiles, mais les prix sont contenus. L'accueil est irrprochable et le petit djeuner est trs correct.\nVERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH DIRECTIONS, KNOWING ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TO VISIT AND WHERE TO EAT TH BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. The Front Desk Receptionists were extremely helpful ..especially Sabrina who made us feel very welcomed to Lido....We will be back next year for sure!\nNo shower but jets in the bathtub and my room was slanted but made it work\nHotel sympathique et silencieux sur l ile du Lido a quelques minutes en vaporetto de Venise. Personnels trs avenants et parlants plusieurs langues, dont le franais. Voyage dpaysant et inoubliable... aucune voiture l horyzon\nHavde 7 overnatninger i april 2015 p Hotel Russo Palace p Lidoen i Venedig. Personalet var alle ualmindeligt hjlpsomme, sde og imdekommende. Vi fik mange gode tips til restauranter og sevrdigheder. God og hjertelig stemning. Rolig beliggenhed. Morgenmaden var god med meget at vlge imellem.\nReally enjoyed the stay, about a 10min walk to the main waterbus station. Had the perfect quiet location and staff were really friendly!!\nNyrenovert bad hevet opplevelsen.\nPrima uitval basis voor stedentrip. Rustige buurt\nWalls extremely thin, you can hear everything. Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom. There. Is a bar, but no one to tend it.\nIf you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.\nHotel facilities are good and breakfast ample. Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine, the occational bump but for the price you cant really complain.\nFriendly reception very helpful. Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction. We used the spa one day. Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small. Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice.\nIt was a bit far from city center\nGreat hotel, staff where amazing and the location and views make this a great Base to visit Venice!\nClose to Venice and decent hotel, breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need.\nbeautiful views of Venice in the lovely relaxed calmer area of Lido Di Venezia. Gorgeous sunsets and very easy to access Venice, rather than satying in the hustle and bustle. Close to only beaches in Venice. Staff were so helpful, especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning.\nThis is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.\nNice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didn't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money.\nWir waren das erste mal in Venedig und wrden jederzeit wieder dieses auf Lido gelegene Hotel buchen. Freundlicher Service, direkt am Kanal mit tollem Blick und entspanntes Parken.\nNice and clean. Rooms are spacious with air conditioning. Good selection of breakfast. Within easy reach of San Marco.

Unfortunately, I arrived while the front entrance was under-construction. There was not sufficient signage to find out how to enter the building. I would have left, had I not already had a reservation through Hotels.com.\nReprehensible three days without maid service despite telling the management after it had happened the first time. I would not recommend this hotel for this reason.\nThe pictures on the web site were more expensive looking then the reality. We were told we had one of the best rooms, besides staring at cargo containers, the TV would not work so they changed our room. It was not well furnished and we could not regulate the air conditioner (way too warm for sleeping). The continental breakfast was good and the staff was very nice and helpful. The linens were harsh and uncomfortable. Sorry, but this was not at all what I expected and it was certainly unacceptable.\nThe didn't tell me they were gonna run my credit card for accidental for a 100 charge. They just told me they had to double check my ID and the credit card that was used.\nI stayed here with some girlfriends for a wine tasting getaway. The staff pointed out some great wineries and restaurants and were very friendly.\nBeautiful hotel. Very clean and service was great. This is a must stay and if I'm in need of a hotel in the Livermore area, this is the place to stay.\nThe room was big and the hotel staff were nice, but I couldn't get over the smelly linens. When I lay down on the bed, all I could smell was dirty old sweat socks! I don't think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens!They were that horrible! I had to spray the linens with perfume so I wouldn't smell them 'au naturel' while I'm sleeping! I'm never going to stay in this hotel ever again!\nNice place no complaints, one thing they didn't tell me,is they put a 100 hold on your card that stays for a couple days after you check out. I know this is not rare but any place that does has told me. I ended up calling trying to get it refunded. The breakfast in morning was pretty good, they had a full buffet not just some pakage pastries. Leave your swimsuit at home though the pool is small very small.\nGreat stay for our night downtown Livermore at Bankhead Theater concert. Birthday celebration for friend. The most comfortable bed ever! Nice patio where we spent our morning catching up. Hotel under construction did not bother us.\nPerfect for my family to relax for the Easter weekend and for my girlfriend's Livermore 1/2 marathon!\nThe hotel was great. There was little construction going on which altered where they served breakfast, but it didn't bother us any.\nHaving never been to Livermore, imagine my shock when the 2nd floor balcony room overlooked a parking lot and a gas station with a Jack in the Box thrown in for good measure. I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced.\nThe bathroom sink splashes water, need to be fixed. The bathtub/shower make loud noises. Other than that, it was a good stay.\nGreat\nNice in/out along the freeway. I thought it was a little high for what it was.\nBeds and pillows were nice. And the television was good as well. The pool was closed.\nMy husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The breakfast in the morning was delicious with a good selection of food and beverages. We will definitely stay here again and refer friends and family too.\nClose to freeway on/off ramp. enjoyed the stay\nThis hotel was promoted as being in the wine country. However, it was a block from the freeway. When we asked the desk clerk about this, she pointed her finger toward the door and said, It's about 4 miles that way. We had a great view of Jack in the Box parking lot. When we first entered our room and kicked off our shoes, we found ourselves stepping on numerous sand burrs left on the carpet. After working out and returning to our room at 9am, there was no hot water for the shower. The breakfast was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly.\nCame for concert at Wente. Last time I traveled to area the accomodations had a shuttle service. That would be a nice amenity if you could add it. Great clean place to stay.\nOnly problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city. As a result, lots of kids, the room next to ours had the TV blaring until midnight and then on again a 5 am. We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing left. We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat. Outside of that, our stay was very nice. The gentleman at the front desk was especially cordial and accommodating.\nIt was cold in the room. We couldn't get the heater on easily for some reason but then when the heat temperature finally came on we were sweating in the middle of the night. I would like a better thermostat or better direction. The hot breakfast was great!!!\nAll the rooms have been recently renovated. They are in the process of renovating the lobby area. The room was new and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bed linen looks new too. Its also nice to have electrical sockets at desk level and plenty of them. The breakfast was so so... eggs, sausages and hashbrown (no fruits) but barely edible.\nLet's face it, this is NOT in the Livermore 'wine country'....you can throw a rock from your room to busy InterState 580 and never come close to a vine or vineyard!\nIt was OK . they paid for the ice I purached.\nI must say the GM at this hotel Catherine is the bomb! She was very attentive and helpful. The hotel was very clean and the staff were all very nice to us from the moment we walked in the door. I would stay here every time I'm in California. Thanks again Cat!\nThe hotel was great, but the Buffet Breakfast was the worst I have ever had! The bacon taste like cardboard, eggs and sausage were cold, Pastries were hard and very little fruit. The only thing hot and worth eating was fixing yourself a waffle at the waffle machine if you didn't mind waiting in line for it.\nThe Hawthorne Suites offers an affordable, comfortable environment that is convenient to the 580 freeway (just south of it) and within a mile and a half of downtown Livermore. Room was incredibly clean and comfortable. While they are currently going through a renovation, which I think will be really nice once it is completed, we rarely had any indication of the ongoing construction activities. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.\nMy family stated the place was nice as they were here for my wedding. Location was great and only 10 minutes away from destinations.\nVery comfortable rooms, will stay again when in the area.\nStaff was great and rooms were clean and very comfortable.\nStayed at this hotel as part of a nearby wedding. I have to say I was impressed. Was greeted by Catherine at the front desk. I had spoke with her earlier before arriving and she was great on the phone and she was so sweet at check in. Very friendly, accommodating, and engaging. Really started the stay off right. The... More\nWhat a pleasant surprise! We are use to staying at expensive four star hotels but needed to complete a quick business trip and we were so delighted with this hotel. All newly remodeled, pleasant professional staff, and the hot breakfast was a perfect addition. Highly recommend and you will not be disappointed!\nThe hotel is absolutely beautiful. We were very impressed by the dcor everything was clean and felt very upscale. The hotel is located near the freeway. There is a gas station, fast food, and shopping nearby. We were in town for a family event so we didn't do much exploring, but there seemed to be many amenities right in the area. The best part was the proximity to downtown Livermore. Wonderful shopping and dining opportunities, and only 5 minutes away. Also, the wineries are within a 10 minute drive. All in all, a wonderful place to stay and lots to do in the area.\nThe most convenient place to stay in Livermor and where we will stay in the future.\nVery nice for the price.\nThe room was clean, spacious, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were in Livermore for a two-day stay, and it was a nice quiet retreat in the midst of family chaos.\nAll was great, until the heater/AC came on. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner every time it turned on. Waking me up over and over. The room would get to hot then to cold. Had a horrible night sleep. Vroom -- Vroom. Clean, friendly, comfy bed, all ruined by a Motel-6 quality wall unit.\nThere's nothing wrong with the hotel except that there are flood lights shining in your window while you sleep and the curtains don't close. I really like the furniture The bedding was clean the pillows are great. Next time I will ask for a room with windows on the other side.\nThe hotel itself was very nice. Staff was very helpful, especially with accommodating us when we asked to check in early. The problem was with cleanliness. Our room was not clean enough - I found a floss stick on the table in our room. What looked like a condom was found when we went to use the spa. And the pool was full of leaves and dirt on the bottom. Otherwise, our room would have been great. Very large with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Nice large screen tv as well - made my husband happy.\nMediocre. The carpets and elevator reek of sour wine. Evidently they have regular wine Thursdays here. Service was somewhat lacking. I requested a wakeup call, they didn't do it. Finally, the free breakfast was on the poor side. Daddy, this bacon tastes like tuna.\nNice experience, despite the re-modeling construction. Friendly and courteous hotel staff. Beautiful new room decor and ambience.\nOne night only, but a nice one. New renno's high quality throughout. Comfy, modern accomodation. Our room overlooked grazing cattle and the relentless I-580, so it was busy, but totally silent. We'll be back.\nGuy at front desk was a jerk, smart Alec\nWhen I made reservations at this hotel, I had average expectations at that that price rate for that area. However the newly renovated room, the professional staff and the cleanliness and the comfort of really surprised me and I will definitely go back.\nWe stayed for two nights. The lobby was nice and the breakfast was good. However, the room was not properly cleaned upon arrival and the same issues remained on the second day. Would have expected much better at this price.\nI have stayed here twice now and loved it both times. Staff are very courteous and welcoming. The pool can use an upgrade but we still had a great time lounging next to the pool.\nClean, safe, friendly, brand new, hotel- :)\nThe last time I stayed at this hotel, it was under remodeling and one of the rooms I was placed in had a heating unit that did not work. I moved to another room, which was okay, but not as nice a room. This time, my granddaughter and I checked in at about 4:30 p.m. and the room was extremely... More\nVisiting family\nPerfect, best hotel over others in the area\nThe hotel is under renovation so lobby and other areas were blocked off. Room was very nice but breakfast were less than tasty.\nStaff was very nice. Hotel is updating it's lobby and reception area so there was a bit of construction. Did not hamper anything. Breakfast was fine, room was nice and quite spacious and again hotel employees were very nice.\nGreat hotel in a great neighborhood. Will definitely be staying here again. Room was very spacious. Free breakfast was great! It was raining so we didn't get to use the pool but it seemed very nice. A little pricey but its a very nice hotel! Free wi-fi and free parking - additional pluses!\nVery comfortable and accommodating. From making our reservation to our time spent, the Hawthorn in Livermore was really nice. I did have to find the direct phone number to get assurance our needs would be met as the central hotel reservation system is simply not equipped to handle any details. Once accessed the staff was most gracious and reassuring and... More\nI work in Livermore and stayed the night to celebrate with friends. The location is close to downtown and the local wineries. My boyfriend and I were very pleased with the accommodations, the room was clean and large. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. I will stay here again.\nA nice hotel, it was undergoing renovation when I stayed so shou be finished soon. Staff was helpful and friendly. Only complaint is the breakfast.\nI live somewhat local in Redwood City, but it's far enough away that after spending the evening with High School Friends, having a 30th gathering wasn't an official reunion, at a local beer pub, we didn't want to chance driving home after having a few beers. We made the reservation Friday night, and honestly, was apprehensive because of some of the reviews. Pleasantly surprised! The place was clean, it's had a facelift and looks good. The bathroom tub could use an update...but I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible. I'd take this room over that one any day! The breakfast the next morning was good. Nothing to write home about, but it offers a great selection and the eggs weren't watered down. Sausage was good...bacon...well, that looked and smelled like a dog treat. Passed on that one. But the coffee was decent and overall, was very pleased with our last minute choice to stay there...would do it again and would recommend others! It was 1/2 mile from the pub and right at the freeway, so leaving was easy, too.\nExcellent Staff\nWe booked this hotel because we had a wedding. It was impeccable, comfortable, and they had an excellent breakfast.\nI was at the hotel for a wedding and all of the staff, Catherine in particular, were incredibly helpful and accommodating. I also loved that there were different types of pillows on the beds!\nStayed here for a wedding weekend. Easily accessible from the freeway, 5min drive to downtown Livermore, good weekend stay for wine tasting or weddings, not much of a view in any direction. Rooms were clean with modern decor. Parking was free. Free continental breakfast. They were remodeling the dining area during our stay but it didn't bother us too much.... More\nVery nice hotel and staff, the location was also perfect because it was easy to get to due being close freeway exit.\nOur family reserved 6 rooms for 2-4 days for a family event. 3 of the 6 rooms had some significant disappointments, including blood and feces on the sheets, and roaches in the room. Our daughter turned her refrigerator on upon check in and then stocked it with food. Housekeeping turned it off and the food spoiled. Gentleman at the front... More\nEverything was good. The front desk staff was fine, but I thought they could've been a more friendly and welcoming.\nSheets were filthy, jacuzzi was freezing with bugs in it, the breakfast had options but the eggs and bacon tasted terrible!\nWanted to check out their wine tasting, the wine trolly was fun and affordable, the wine was great, the food downtown was good, nice atmosphere. Our Hotel was conveniently located very close to everything we wanted to do. Got some great deals at the outlets, which were close by, as well. Great weekend stay.\nThe pillows were way too soft without pillowcases. The mattress was so soft my back was aching. When i awoke in the am since I arrived so late and did not notice I flipped the covers off and there was dried blood on the sheets. I could not leave fast enough. Sorry but never again. The next night I stayed... More\nClean, comfortable room. Breakfast was good. Coffee not bad. The bacon was weird. Soy maybe Kinda gross. Many people threw it away. Everything else was fine. Not over the top amazing, but I think I got my money's worth.\nSuper solid, well-maintained but nothing to write home about. Breakfast buffet, while complimentary was pretty lackluster, but a nice feature nonetheless.\nI frequently go to Livermore for business travel and always stay at this hotel. The hotel is always clean, beds are super comfy, staff is friendly, free breakfast in the morning and wine in the evening. What else could you ask for when you are traveling\nStayed for a week - from early check-in assistance to excellent accommodations, it was all I could hope for in a multi-day business stay.\none night stay to attend concert/dinner at winery\nThis hotel has a great, friendly staff, clean rooms, comfy beds and pillows and the price is right. Would stay there again when I am in town.\nI expected more from a Wyndham hotel......bathroom was very small, not enough counter space for makeup bag and shaving kit. Amenities were not replenished. Had to ask for coffee replacements, then were given single serve bags for a 4 cup coffee maker! Coffee maker eventually replaced, but I had to ask... twice! And the word suite. Is not too accurate.... More\nMy husband and I came out here from Tennessee for a business conference / couples getaway. It's our first full day here and I'm already so impressed with this hotel! The hotel and the room are both clean and pretty . The staff is super friendly and the front desk girl even printed out a map of things I might...

There was even a chaise lounge with a computer table, as well as lots of outlets for our electronics. Front staff is always helpful and polite.\nexcellent service and location for wedding party. staff worked hard at accommodating numerous guests.\nThe hotel was fine, I with the shower (specifically the shower head) was cleaner, it could you a thorough scrubbing and white vinegar cleaning.\nWe found this hotel because of its connection to the Livermore Shakespeare Festival. They offered a dinner-theater-hotel package that was perfect for our first time at this venue. The hotel is conveniently located close enough to the freeway to be easily accessible but far enough away to be out of the traffic noise. The Hawthorn staff were very pleasant and...

This meant that any time our curtains were open, we were on display for whoever was walking/driving by. It also meant we couldn't safely leave our window(s) open at night and had to rely on the very, very loud air conditioner. Although outdated, our room was very reasonable. There... More\nCame to Binghamton to visit with a relative. Fairfield Inn is a convenient location. Nearby is Ostinango Park which is great for walking or running.\nGreat Experience. Nice Staff clean rooms good free breakfast\nNot a lot of options where I needed to stay for work, but this hotel was nice. Fairly updated and the staff was friendly. Walking distance to Cracker Barrel and Applebee's, which was nice. Other restaurants within driving distance. Easy to get to, right off interstate. If I was back in town for work, I'd stay here again for sure.\nThis hotel is undergoing construction. Banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning. Forget about enjoying a peaceful morning.Was very disappointed by the reaction of the hotel staff when I brought it to their attention. A free night's stay or at least a discount on my next stay may have helped the situation. Dont book this hotel until the construction is complete\nGood Location, right off highway. Applebees next door...you can walk there! Hallway was dirty but the roomwas very clean and comfortable.\nThe hotel was fairly new and slightly out of town. The pool was refreshing. Breakfast was adequate but as usual in hotels like this, when crowded jockeying for a spot to sit can be a challenge.\nRooms are very small, especially for a family of 4. Beds were not very comfortable and the bathroom was also small (straddle the toilet to close the door small). The pool area was not so great. Hot tub was cloudy and the whole area had a septic smell.\nNeeds more ice machines.\nTrs bon sjour, tout prs de la 81, restaurant tout ct, petit-djeuner bien garni, literie confortable.\nThe staff at the Fairfield Inn were amazing. They arranged a cab for us, offered us hot tea after a late night arrival on a very cold evening, they check in on us the next day to make sure we were settled and had everything we needed. They made sure our stay at their hotel was comfortable. An extra thank you to Candice, Bea, and Donna. Thank you ladies for going above and beyond. Great breakfast in the morning too!!\nEasily accessible in spite of traffic on 17. Clean. Bath a teensy bit small but still acceptable. We had a king bed - that's all they had available, but the two doubles may have been a little tight. We did use a rollaway cot for our son (5'10, 150lbs) and wound up putting the mattress on the floor the second night as the frame was simply too small for a teenage boy!\nI often stay at Hampton Inns but one was not conveniently located so I opted for this Fairfield Inn near Bingham ton because it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier. What a mistake ! The motel, although the room was clean and comfortable, was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities. I would have walked out but I had a no cancellation reservation. When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul. So. if the management knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate. This experience guarantees that I will avoid Fairfield in the future and recommend that other travelers stay away also\nvisiting family... convienient to get to... room was clean... pool water could have been warmer... overall, we were satisfied.\nIt was convenient a little noisy in the room with the traffic on the road (room facing the front of the building).\nOverpriced, small room with absolutely no view, furnishings showed years of wear and tear, small bath with thin towels, very mediocre breakfast. Worst and most expensive hotel we stayed in on a 11 night vacation sleeping in 9 different cities in 6 states\nsince most important thing for me is bed comfort, I'd say this is a winner. Nice staff, clean room. Breakfast was standard low quality mass free food, but that is to be expected.\nPool was good temp.. hot tub very enjoyable. Breakfast was good with lots of choices\nClean, spacious room. Pool and hot tub were clean.\nThis was a very nice hotel. The staff was particularly friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast was great, and they had the most comfortable beds I have slept in at a hotel! Would highly recommend.\nEverything was great - very clean hotel, very clean room, excellent service at the front desk, great variety of food at breakfast. Only downside was the cost.\nThis was a fine, clean hotel. Good-sized pool and exercise room. Rooms were clean, check-in was easy. Good breakfast with waffles, eggs, bacon, yogurt, muffins, etc., etc.\nThis was a fine, clean hotel. Good-sized pool and exercise room. Rooms were clean, check-in was easy.

It is the cleanest, friendliest, and has the best breakfast around for the price. I choose Fairfield Inn's because I consistantly have a pleasurable experience there.\nWas hoping for a nicer room based on higher room rates than other offerings. What we found was just a plain room.

The room was very clean - but my son did find a skittle under the bed, wedged into the corner. I think it's his goal to find 'anything' when he enters a hotel room. The beds were very comfy as were the pillows, and we were even able to enjoy the pool for a while. All in all this was a very nice hotel and the staff was great. They didn't even cringe when we walked back in after the run covered in wild colors :-)\nClean comfortable room with pleasant staff. No problems.\nWe stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still... Would return but probably only if there is no other option.\nWe stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us.

The complimentary breakfast was a basic offering but much appreciated. The toilet tank had a small leak, but was only evident the morning of checkout.\nThe only complaint was trying to regulate the heat/cooling system.\nNice, clean and new motel. Wish the bathroom was a bit bigger. Wife did a quick turn and bruised her hip o the metal door latch.\nNice Hotel, close to Applebees, which delivered right to your room. The continental breakfast was also very good.\nGood experience and very convenient to where I needed to be. Hotel was quiet and staff polite and helpful. Conveniently located between two restaurants that serve decent food at reasonable prices. Only downside was that hotel room was a bit dusty... not unclean but bedside lamp had dust on base. Very well out-fitted with outlets, however, which is needed these days. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay.\nFrom the moment of check in we were pleased. Greeted cordially (not fake) we were asked if we would need anything additional (we were 6 adults and 5 children under the age of 6 renting 3 rooms). They had already put our rooms nearby (even when requested at other hotels in advance this seems to be a HUGE request and usually not done) We have stayed at other hotels in the area but your rooms are spacious and beds are wonderful. We will continue to return here anytime we are in the area.\nWe were thrilled with everything from the cleanliness to the top notch breakfast to the kindness of everyone but, the very first person we met. She was the first person we approached behind the counter when we arrived. Later we learned that she was handling both the desk and the Housekeeping roles that night. If I were to judge the facility by this one person, I would have been disappointed in her lack of hospitality in answering our questions: no smile, no patience...cranky. However the rest of our stay, and we did add an extra night, more than made up for it. This was my first getaway in 4 years on ANY kind of vacation/family celebration, so I was really hoping for a good time. I really enjoyed the cleanliness, as I own a cleaning service here in MD. Thank you so much for an overall excellent stay!!!\nThe staff was indifferent to my stay. For example, almost had to convince the front desk to go through the effort to sell me another night stay. I almost went to another hotel because it seemed too much trouble to check me out and then check me back in. Not likely to return.\nTravel mid point stop over\nI had never stayed at a Fairfield Inn. I was very impressed with the staff., they were excellent. The rooms were great and the service was even better. Would definitely recommend anyone looking for a hotel to stay at a Fairfield Inn.\nVery friendly staff and excellent breakfast choices.

Also, we received half used bottle of shampoo.\nVery friendly staff and excellent breakfast choices.

Upon checking in was told that the place was booked with folks who are running from Isaac -- the folks are depressed, sad and crying -- we got a room with no problem as a matter of fact the parking lot and inside hotel were rather empty despite the fact that the place was booked -- the room reaked -- air conditioning unit blew out luke warm air despite having control turned to high cool -- linens and bath towels were rough and ...view morewell worn. The corridors reaked of curry/incense and it was obvious other air freshners were used to mask the obvious odors. Not opposed to other cultures but if you are going to have that sort of thing waifing through the hotel you should advertise such. My expectations are a clean room with no visible signs of anything else... would NOT recommend this place... BTW the free breakfast was nothing more than day old bakery goods with what was suppose to be biscuits and gravy... the folks running from Isaac would have been better off to weather the storm!

But that doesn't outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadn't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!\nThe hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection.

We got to the motel, Melissa the front desk clerk, was very friendly and got us checked in quickly. The rooms were big and seemed clean enough at first but as we settled in for the night we could tell the housekeepers defiantly needed to be retrained on how to clean... More\nTerrible stay. Everything in the room felt damp as it was terribly humid. The place was dated and breakfast omelets were made in a different ZIP code or worse. The orange juice burned our throats fro the acidity. They had a cardboard like of the man in the advertisents. Now everytime I see his likeness I will run away.\nEasy and quick check-in. Room was a positive surprise, clean and spacious Pet friendly . Breakfast was basic but good good half way point from Phoenix to Milwaukee. Next trip we will stay here again.\nOverall stay was ok. The towels could have used a little more in the wash. They were dingy and you could see past stains on them. Walls had hand stains on them.

Steve and Enoch know Mobile very well and can refer to all sorts of attractions, restaurants, etc. Mobile itself is just exquisite and is a fascinating place (at 300+ yearsw, it's one of the oldest cities in the US) and the downtown restaurants are TERRIFIC.

Steve and Enoch are wonderful and attentive hosts, the rooms are immaculate, the service is first-rate (and be sure to check out their pool in the back!). A definite must stay.\nMy girlfriend and I had a really nice time at Berney Fly Bed and Breakfast.

The proprietors are friendly and talkative. Steve made sure we had suggestions on places to go and eat while we were there. I really enjoyed the breakfasts.

Steve was available to answer any question that we had. Good value. We spent only one evening, but wished we had stayed two.\nThe service and the food was above average. The room was clean and quiet, but dated. A excellent location in a charming neighborhood. A beautiful new swimming pool and spa, made a charming yard. It is a big house that needs work, but we enjoyed our stay.\nThis is a lovely B and B with helpful, friendly staff who love Mobile. It's located in the Oakleigh Gardens District near excellent restaurants. The 1895 home is beautifully decorated in period furnishings and it has a lovely pool for a cool down swim.

The location is good with easy access to all points in Mobile. Steve, the operator, is welcoming. Steve admits that much of the house is due for a makeover.

Thanks again!!!\nWhen we had booked this hotel we had emailed in advanced asking if we could store out luggage while we went camping, they seemed to have no problem with this, until we arrived. When we asked where we would keep our bags the lady insisted we must have been confused even after we had shown her the email stating we... More\nPositives: Location! It is on the main strip, next to Hard Rock Cafe and lots of food options. Walking distance to Waikiki Beach and The Cheesecake Factory. Room size is decent. Negatives: In major need of a renovation! Very outdated and the lifts smell. Wifi connection is poor. Overall, would stay here again.\nWe spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the the normal hotels we stay at were double the normal cost. The location of this hotel is GREAT, it has a nice good size flat screen TV with cable/Sat TV, and both beds were actually pretty comfortable - at this poit there is nothing else that I...

The elevator is a little bit sketchy but we never really used it (only for when we arrived with all the luggage and for when we left)....

In early October, I called this hotel to find out more about the bathroom size and to my horror, the hotel just cancelled my reservations without informing me. Can you imagine if I had arrived on that day with 2 children to only find out I have no where to stay... More\nFor the price that I paid for the room, it was horrific meaning that when me and my wife got into the room, IT WAS VERY HOT! The next thing was that the elevator wasn't working, it took us over 45 minutes to find out that the hotel didn't have a parking spot after making circles and finally, the shower...

It is the best location-in my opinion-with everything from awesome dining to 3 blocks walk to public beach (with beachside drinks/snack shack).

More\nSchnes,grosses Zimmer. Sehr sauber und super Frhstck. W-LAN leider nur fr 1 Gert inklusive\nDa im Haupthaus kein passendes Zimmer mehr frei war, buchte ich ein Appartement im separaten App.-Haus. Das ebenerdige Appartement war gut eingerichtet mit einem sehr schnen Bad. Leider fhrte der Zugang zu den anderen Appartements direkt am Schlafzimmerfenster vorbei, was mit sehr strender Geruschentwicklung verbunden war.\nWir hatten ein super schnes gerumiges Zimmer mit erstklassigem Service (leider die Betten mit Besucherritze, ... :-( ) Frhstck ist auch sehr zu empfehlen, alles da was das Herz begehrt, es wird bis zur letzten Minute noch nachgelegt. Fr Langschlfer, man wird auch vor dem abrumen des Bfetts (11:30 Uhr) noch einmal gefragt ob man noch etwas mchte. Die Sauna hat fr uns um 21:00 Uhr geschlossen, das ist im Urlaub doch etwas frh. Aber sonst waren wir rund um zu frieden. Khlungsborn wir kommen bestimmt wieder.\nVery nice hotel with very nice atmosphere. Definitely something I'd recommend. The interior was renovated probably 10 years ago, so it's not brand new, but it's clean and comfortable. The Hotel CEO and the manager on duty took their time to talk to all guests one evening and ask about our stay etc. over a glass of champagne (free of charge). I've never seen such good service at a hotel. I should mention the spa and pool - very good bonus. If I had to say something negative - the internet connection. It's simply criminal to have such a slow and unstable internet connection in 2015. And may be, king size beds that are not to single beds with tendency to move apart.\nDie Zimmer ( App. ) lagen nicht im Haupthaus ( kein Hinweis darauf ), im Zeitraum unseres Aufenthaltes wurden Bauarbeiten in mehreren Zimmern gleichzeitig durch gefhrt ( Fliesen entfernt, Wannen, Duschtrger, Dacharbeiten usw.) Fr Bademntel muss eine Leihgebhr entrichtet werden, da Appartement, normale Zimmer kostenlos, Reinigung ( kein Besen oder der gleiche im App. ) und Handtuch Wechsel gegen Entgelt, da Appartement, ist nur auf der Homepage des Hotel einsehbar, nicht bei Expedia selbst. Zur Nutzung des SPA ca. 75 m an der Strae entlang, da wieder im Haupthaus. Frhstck ausreichend, war bei uns inkl., ansonsten 18,- p. P. etwas berzogen finden wir. Personal super nett. Auf ansprechen der Mngel wurde ein Preisnachlass gewhrt.\nWunderschne Zimmer, Bademantelgang optimal, Frhstck sehr lecker in gemtlicher Atmosphre. Parkplatz 8 Euro am Tag fr Gste des Hotels zhlt fr mich leider nicht zu gutem Service. sonst alles Bestens\nDas Zimmer glich einer kleinen Ferienwohnung mit seperatem Schlafzimmer, Wohnzimmer mit kleiner Kchenzeile und Bad. Aufenthalt mit Hund war mglich und wurde sogar mit einer kleiner Aufmerksamkeit fr den Vierbeiner noch verschndert. Das Frhstck war sehr lecker und hatte eine reichhaltige Auswahl. Alles war sehr sauber und ordentlich. Lediglich an der Rezeption war ein Mitarbeiter sehr berheblich und patzig. Zuerst wurden wir eingewiesen und es wurde uns ein Parkplatz zugewiesen. Nachdem wir bereits standen und uns auf in den Ortskern machen wollten, hielt uns der Mitarbeiter an und teilte uns mit, dass wir nun pro Nacht fr den Parkplatz 15 zahlen mssten. Auf Nachfrage, warum uns das denn nicht vorher mitgeteilt worden sei, bekamen wir die patzige Antwort, dass das jawohl berall steht und auch auf der Website zu finden sei. Meine Meinung Selbst wenn - ein kundenfreundlicher Mitarbeiter htte 1.) freundlicher Reagiert und 2.) aus Servicegedanken in jedem Fall vorher nochmal darauf hingewiesen. Leider haben wir uns den Namen des Mitarbeiters nicht gemerkt. Die anderen waren jedoch alle sehr freundlich und deutlich hilfsbereiter als dieser eine. Alles in Allem kann man einen Aufenthalt hier sehr empfehlen - wenn man sich ggf. ber die ntigen Informationen selbst und im Vorfeld erkundigt.\nSchner Spa-Bereich, angenehmer Service, aufwendiges Frhstcksbffet\nKein Aufzug im Gebude, Kein Handtuch wechsel ,keine Zimmerreinigung etc. Zu Sauberkeit der Zimmer kann ich keine Angaben machen!\nEs war ein super Aufenthalt fr einen Kurzurlaub. Der Wellness Bereich ist total schn. Die Restaurants sind top - vor allem vom Ambiente. Das Frhstck war das bisher beste fr ein Hotel (vor allem bis 11:30 ) )\nWir waren zu einem Kurzurlaub in Khlungsborn. Das Hotel macht einen guten Eindruck. Negativ war der Parkplatzmangel, ein berforderter Barkeeper am 30.08.2015 und ein fehlender Fahrstuhl in die dritte Etage. Die Ostsee war khl in Khlungsborn (17 C)und ... zwei Verabstaltungen fielen im Ort aus. Warum Es regnete!!!\nWir waren fr 4 Nchte vom 01.11.2015 im Nebengebude untergebracht.Im Zimmer angekommen,wurde uns gleich eine Nachricht gereicht,dass es bei unserem Aufenthalt zu Lrmbelstigungen kommen wird(Baulrm)und man uns dafr eine Entschdigung in Form einer Flasche Rotwein brachte.Da wir tagsber viel unterwegs waren,hielt sich die Belstigung fr uns in Grenzen.Bedauerlich fanden wir jedoch,das nicht zur Verfgung stehende Bademntel(nicht einmal gegen Gebhr).Wir htten eigentlich fr die Benutzung hochwertiger Wellnesbehandlungen einen Bademantel als selbstverstndlich gedacht....\nTolles Frhstcksbuffet, freundliches Personal, schner Spa-Bereich, Strandnhe\n4 1/2 Sterne gebucht und nichts dafr erhalten. Wir haben ein abgewohntes, schmuddeliges Appartment verordnet bekommen. Nebenhaus mit Blick auf Parkplatz. Von Idylle keine Spur. Von mehr als vier Sternen schon gar nicht. Es hatte alles den Charme einer Jugendherberge der neunziger Jahre. Vorsicht: niemand, der das nicht wirklich mag, sollte die Appartments buchen. Gereinigt wird vor Einzug wenig und whrend des Aufenthalts gar nicht. Im Flur stehen im Besenschrank eben Besen und luxurises Toilettenpapier. Ein- oder zweilagig. Zur Selbstbedienung. Wahrer Luxus eben. Bademantel und Slippers sucht man auch vergebens. Das wre auch wirklich zu viel verlangt. Nur weil am Besenschrank noch das Hotel vier Jahreszeiten grt und weil man in der Lobby eben jenes Hotels eincheckt, und auch ganz schnell wieder aus, heit das ja nicht, dass die Unterkunft im Nebengebude auch die fr 4 Sterne gesetzen Standards erfllen muss. Auch wenn die Appartments Mozart und andere klangvolle Namen tragen, sollte man eher nichts erwarten, dann wird man auch nicht allzusehr enttuscht. Vom Namen Mozart ausgehend: es mssen Mozarts letzte Jahre gewesen sein, die in dem zugigen, modrigen Loch in einer dunklen Senke Wiens.\nUitstekend hotel op een prachtige locatie en goede faciliteiten.\nZimmer etwas abgewohnt aber noch ok., Service und Frhstcksbuffet sehr gut.\nEin sehr erholsames langes Wochenende in Khlungsborn. Das Hotel liegt direkt an der Strandpromenade und zum Zentrum sind es nur wenige Minuten. Der Ort bietet sehr viel und wirkt durchgehend sehr gepflegt. Wir werden wieder dort hin fahren.\nsehr schnes Appartment in ruhiger Lage fr kleine Familie mit Kche und extra Kinderzimmer, so dass Selbstverpflegung gut mglich ist das Frhstck war reichhaltig und immer frisch bei Fragen oder Wnschen wurde immer sofort vom Personal reagiert - top\nSehr gutes Frhstcksbfett in sehr angenehmem Ambiente und aufmerksamen und freundlichen Mitarbeitern\nNettes Hotel mit grozgigem Appartement und 2 Balkonen im 2. Stock ohne Fahrstuhl. Mngel: Sauberkeit der Balkone (Tisch mit Flecken), Rahmen der Balkon stark verschmutzt ( Rotweinflecken und jede Menge Deck) Duschvorhang keine Kabine. Ein unangemessen Duft im Bad, der scheinbar aus dem Lfter kommt. stark verkratzt Holzfuboden Schwimmbad ist im Haupthaus, das nur ber die Strae zu erreichen ist. Frhstck habe ich in einem 4****- Haus schon Besseres geboten bekommen. War ok, aber keine 18 wert.\nSehr schnes Haus , netter aufmerksamer Service ,sehr gutes Essen einschl. Frhstcksbffet , aber Balkon nicht nutzbar , da die Entlftung der Kche genau am Balkon endet :-(\nWir waren 4 Tage in dem Hotel und haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt. Sehr gut fanden wir auch die Lage des Hotels, man ist schnell am Strand und die Einkaufsmglichkeiten sind auch nicht weit entfernt.\nWir haben uns sehr wohl gefhlt. Unser Zimmer war sauber und sehr nett eingerichtet. Wir waren trotz des nicht so schnem Wetter am Strand und dann ab in die Sauna oder in den Pool. Das war sehr entspannend.Da wir von Montag bis Donnerstag da waren war es nicht so voll und das war sehr angenehm. Es gibt genug Geschfte zum Shoppen und man kann auch einfach nur an der Promenade spazieren gehen.\nDen Aufenthalt vom 3. bis 8.5.2015 haben wir sehr genossen. Die Atmosphre im Hotel war sehr angenehm. Leider haben wir erst zu spt erfahren, dass es mglich gewesen wre, sowohl einen Khlschrank als auch einen Heiwasserbereiter zu bekommen, denn das waren die Dinge, die wir in einem Doppelzimmer de Luxe vermisst haben. Unser Zimmer war wie gewnscht mit einem Aufzug erreichbar und hatte auch einen Balkon. Sollten wir wieder einen Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel planen, wrden wir, abhngig von der Jahreszeit, ein Zimmer Richtung Osten nehmen, da keine Klimaanlage vorhanden ist und es bei heiem Wetter in Sd- oder Westlage doch recht warm im Zimmer werden knnte.\n#NAME?\nHeizung im Band und Schlafzimmer leider ungengend bzw. ausgefallen. Meldung an Rezeption innerhalb der ersten zwei Stunden des Aufenthaltes (Samstag nachmittag). Antwort, dass man heute nicht mehr machen kann. Keine Entschuldigung oder sonstiges. Zweiter Tag dann wieder an der Rezeption (Bad weiterhin eiskalt). Angebot, dass wir das Zimmer tauschen knnen, jedoch keinerlei Kompensation fr diesen Mangel in einem Vier-Sterne-Hotel. Neues Zimmer: Heizung warm, allerdings abends ein sehr strender Brummton, der nicht genau ortbar war (Resonanz aus etlichen Lftungsrohren, die am Schlafzimmerfenster entlang fhrten). Beschwerde an Rezeption wurde wahrscheinlich in dem Moment wieder vergessen, in dem ich die Tr verlie. Service dieses Mal insgesamt sehr enttuschend. Die etlichen Besuche vorher waren deutlich besser.\nEin sehr sauberes, gut gefhrtes Hotel mit schnem Wellnessbereich. Die Apartments sind leider in einem ca. 50 m entfernten Haus untergebracht, welches man der Buchungsseite nicht entnehmen konnte und den Aufenthalt weniger komfortabel gestalten. Frhstck fand einmal im Apartmenthaus und einmal im Haupthaus statt. Bei nicht so schnem Wetter ist es schon unangenehm den Weg ins Haupthaus zu nehmen. Das WLAN ist sehr langsam und die Aufzugstr schliet mit einem Tempo, welches einer Gesundheitsgefhrdung nahe kommt. Ansonsten sind die Apartments schn und zweckmig eingerichtet. Blick vom Balkon im hinteren Teil auf den Hof oder den Parkplatz. Von der Lage her optimal am Strand von Khlungsborn gelegen.\nBei unserer Ostseerundreise waren wir 4 Nchte mit Frhstck in diesem Hotel. Wir hatten ein Deluxe Zimmer - war sehr ansprechend mit Balkon und Blick etwas verdeckt auf die Ostsee. Frhstck sehr gute Auswahl auch mit Fisch. Wellnessabteilung war auch gut. Nicht so gro aber ausreichend. Wir wrden dieses Hotel wieder buchen und knnen es auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen. Liegt auch gleich an der Strandpromenade und zur Einkaufsmeile ebenfalls nicht weit.\nStrand und Promenade direkt vor der Tr. Wir haben die 5 Tage richtig genossen.

Das Hotel ist ideal gelegen zwischen Khlungsborn-Ost und -West, gleichwohl ist alles Wichtige (vor allem der Strand) fulufig in ca. 1-5 Minuten zu erreichen.\nEs war sehr schn, wir planen wieder dort hin zu fahren.

Das Frhstcksbuffett war jeden Morgen ein perfekter Start in den Tag, wir haben uns vom Hotel Fahrrder gemietet und haben eine Tour nach Warnemnde und zurck gemacht.

Die Mitarbeiterinnen beim Empfang waren auf unsere Ankunft vorbereitet. Die notwendigen Unterlagen lagen bereit. Unterlagen zu Khlungsborn wurden uns unaufgefordert zur Verfgung gestellt. Das Zimmer in der Kategorie de-luxe gefiel uns gut. Auch ein von uns im Vorfeld per Mail mitgeteilter Wunsch war bereits im Zimmer bercksichtigt. Das Zimmer ist sehr gerumig und gediegen eingerichtet. Am Freitagabend wurden wir zusammen mit den anderen neu angereisten Gsten zu einem Sektempfang eingeladen. Die Direktorin und zwei leitende Mitarbeiterinnen gaben uns Informationen zum Hotel, den hoteleigenen Restaurants und Khlungsborn. Das Frhstck war einfach spitze. Wir haben gerne das hoteleigene Schwimmbad genutzt. Des weiteren haben wir im hoteleigenen Wellnessbereich Massagen in Anspruch genommen und haben diese als sehr angenehm empfunden.

Morgens war zu wenig Personal fr die Bewirtung im Frstcksraum.\nals Familie erhielten wir trotz nur einer Nacht ein Upgrade, Frhstck sensationell\nDas 4JahresZeiten ist ein strandnahes, aber ruhig gelegenes Hotel. Das Hotel hat trotz seiner Gre einen eher familiren Charakter und ist dadurch sehr angenehm. Der im Kellergescho gelegene Wellness- und Spa-Bereich bietet ausreichend Mglichkeiten zu relaxen und sich etwas Gutes zu gnnen.\nI have written about The Point previously but wanted to validate another fantastic time here. We celebrated our 20th anniversary at The Point this past week. GM Cameron Karger and team outdid themselves again and again and again. We will be back again and again and again.\nAn experience for life. Just do it! Staff did their utmost to make our stay perfect, and perfect it was. Location is absolutely beautiful and secluded. Rooms and entire estate is very charming. Especially enjoyed taking the boats out on the lake. Hope to return some time in the future.\nWe were picked up from the airport in a car which was not vacuum cleaned for a long time.

More\nThe only place i'll stay in Houston. Fantastic service, incredibly friendly staff, great food and the best fitness options in the entire city. The rooms are a bit small and bathrooms are not luxurious by today's standards, but they are more than adequate and everything else about the place more than makes up for any shortcomings in that department.\nThe room smelled as soon as you walked in. Smelled very humid.\nLoved everything about the Houstoinan from the very attentive car valets to the door greeter. My only complaint concerns the bed pillows. Unfortunately they were very thin flimsy! Loved the pool area gym too!\nwonderful acomadation !\nStayed one night to attend a meeting held the next day. Dined at in-house restaurant, The Olivette, where the wine list and the meal were excellent and the service was very good. The attractively decorated rooms are very quiet with a forest view out the windows. It is hard to imagine you are in the middle of a major city here. The room was very clean and there was nice turndown service. The room was adequately lighted and there were outlets to charge electronics. There were nice pillows on the bed and the linens were crisp and new-looking. Check in and Check Out were a breeze. The front desk verified my expenses and gave me a print out of my charges.\nReally enjoyed the spa. Great facial!\nQuiet, friendly staff, no issues\nExcellent service, beautiful Christmas decor, wonderful time at the Trellis Spa\nMet up with our daughter and had a great time in Houston. The hotel was easy to find and was quite lovely--especially the spa!! Would highly recommend taking time to use the Trellis Spa while in Houston.\nEveryone at the hotel made our stay so amazing. We were there in time to see the harvest decorations being put away and the magnificent Christmas decor being put up. They all did an amazing job. It is definitely more for couples and grown ups. It would feel too stuffy for children\nWe have been staying at the Houstonian hotel for 20 years now and it's never let us down!!! When the staff calls us by our names year after year.... What does that tell u about the hotel management\nHotel was awesome. Service was beyond anything I've gotten before. Room service and food was EXCELLENT.\nGreat place to enjoy relaxing family time. 3 pools! Several restaurants and very friendly staff.\nHotel and hotel staff are amazing, 5 stars. Family pool was awful, our neighborhood pool is 100x's cleaner, better service personnel and life guards that enjoy their job. Great get away for couples or business, leave family at home.\n25th anniv mini getaway. Secluded yet in the Uptown area, great, restrained service.\nLoved the Houstonian!\nWe loved it!\nWe live on the other side of Houston and felt that our stay at the Houstonian was a wonderful getaway. It really felt like we were on holiday. We loved the comfort, the view of the woods and the tranquility of the place.\nVery comfortble, traditional, and family oriented\nGreat stay as always. Superior accommodations, food, fitness classes(31/day)with excellent instructors, grounds, swimming pools. The best in Houston by far.\nThe most relaxing beautiful hotel in Houston. Service is exceptional and staff is excellent. Spa is the best inTexas....\nThe hotel was nice but is very outdated. The bathroom for a family for very, very small. We had a deluxe king room which is good for 4 people but the bathroom was the size fit for a standard room for 2 people.\nReturn guest. Accommodation was great as usual.\nWonderful stay! Great couples retreat. Make sure you stay a couple of days to take advantage of all of the amenities including the Trellis Spa. Will definitely be back for our anniversary. Staff is superb and don't forget to eat at the restaurant downstairs Olivette.\nThe Houstonian may not be the cheapest hotel in the area, but I believe it's the best. It's still a great value when you look at the service, amenities, and location. The grounds make it a wonderful oasis in a busy part of the city. Everything is kept up immaculately and is first class. The rooms have everything you could need for a comfortable stay. I loved walking the beautiful and easy to walk path around the grounds each morning and seeing/hearing all the birds. I didn't use the pool areas, but they are gorgeous and spacious. Highly recommended hotel.\nWe always have a pleasant stay at the Houstonian, love the atmosphere, the rooms are also dark in the morning due to the lush greenery so we are able to get a good nights rest. We were celebrating our triplet grandchildren's 6th Birthday (their favorite hotel) and they were surprised by the hotel with a plate of fresh cookies and milk! Thank you Houstonian!\nI checked in for 10 days, but checked out after 2. My problem with the hotel was room size - particularly bathroom size. The bedroom was adequate. The bathroom ceiling is at about 6.5 feet. The door opens into the tiny bathroom which makes it necessary to close the door making it extremely claustrophobic.\nThe king size bed was the most uncomfortable bed I had slept in for decades. I honestly thought I was sleeping on a sheet of plywood.\nThis hotel is way over rated, it's nothing like the description or the reviews. Basically its Old (very old) building in the heart of apartment complex/parking lot jungle. Furniture is very old, hotel theme feel like 1850s, clean but old. Tge staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced , mostly in there 20s. Room it self spacious but old, old carpet and TV. Bathrooms similar to Motels, bedsheets clean, new sheets, but bed is saggy. Surrounding area is jungle, literally!! Misty and not well kept. Lots traffic once you leave parking. Ppl come from surrounding complex apartments to run on trail. Bottom line, money wasted, will never come again.\nStaff were awesome. By 2 nd day knew our name and were so nice. Will definitely go there again.\nNice hotel, secluded so that you don't feel like you're in the city but convenient for business great exercise facilities for working out. swimming and tennis.\nGreat resort facilities, several pools, including a lap pool and an enormous gym. Room was very comfortable. We went for the concierge package, which included complementary drinks, snacks and continental breakfast. Lovely.\nFantastic hotel.\nWe stop at the Houstonian every year on our way to ski and my 2 teenage boys just love it. We love the location, the food and the workout facilities. My kids especially love the basketball court!\nHotel is very nice. High end finishes. Friendly staff. Bed was comfortable. There was some noise both from other guests and maintenance of grounds. Amenities are exceptional. Food in restaurants was also very good.\nRooms and bathrooms are a little bit outdated, pool and spa is great!\nSo relaxing and nice atmosphere. I took my pregnant girlfriend here as a last minute getaway in our hometown before her 3rd child arrived... we relaxed, rested, and enjoy the quite. The spa serices near by were on point...\nRoom and bathroom were extremely small considering the amount we paid per night to stay.\nWe have stayed at the Houstonian before and it's always top notch. Their holiday decor is amazing, and the staff is always so helpful.\nWe were in Houston for a family event so several families were staying at the Houstonian. We took advantage of the bar for nightcaps and the large fireplace and comfy sitting area off the lobby for complimentary coffee and conversation.\nGreat hotel! The pools were amazing. We will be staying here anytime we go to Houston\nWonderful stay with my boyfriend\nBeen staying there for 25 years. Great food, great gym, grounds amazing, staff super. Enough said!\n5 star accommodations as well as service. Even during the floods- they had staff to help us. We LOVED our time there\nCombination business and family. Really liked the exercise facility and service all around.\nGood hotel.\nMy husband and I took a stacation here and it indeed is a five star from the amazing service to all the updated amenities, pools, gym everything was almost perfect. We chose this hotel after I verified that their shuttle went within 3 miles also viewing this on their website. Well time to take off and there was ' no shuttle ' available on Sunday after 6pm which I could not verify. That put a twist on things, we drove around the corner anyhow.\nWe stayed a couple of nights for our daughter's bday and Father's day weekend for me as well. Everything was topnotch! From the courteous staff and great service down to every little detail. Our rooms were clean and well kept as well as all the public spaces. Our room had a nice view that seemed like we were in the woods. Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few. Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it. Over all, It's a magnificent place to stay with so many things to enjoy while you're at it. And as my title says, It's a Country Club with a little touch of Hotel!\nWe stayed at The Houstonian to celebrate our 17th Wedding Anniversary and are so glad we chose this hotel. There were a few hiccups in our stay, but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven. The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps, which shows that they do care about their guests. I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest. As other reviewers mentioned, the valet service was really top notch and on their game. We will definitely be returning for a staycation at The Houstonian again. Thank you for making it a memorable Anniversary!\nWe came in for wedding. The staff was exceptional. Loved the workout facility. Will definitely stay again next time we are in Houston.\nThe Hotel and its grounds are beautiful, to say the least. Very warm, very welcoming, very grand. The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming as well. Everyone from the front desk to the spa to the bar - same level of amazing service. Speaking of the spa - I have never had a spa experience like this. Unbelievable! The ultimate in luxury in relaxation. Due to the flooding in the area we left a night early, just to be on the safe side. They did not charge us the extra night. I am seriously looking for excuses to stay at this hotel again.\nWhat a fabulous hotel and resort property . Incredible amenities made our family time relaxing and enjoyable, providing us with the perfect getaway escape and memories !!\nThis is a beautiful hotel with great views and excellent amenities. The Spa staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel front desk staff are not as friendly, yet they are professional. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a luxurious weekend getaway.\nThe valets here are awesome. They greet you with a smile and a sense of urgency to help. They provide cold bottles of water each time you leave. While it may look like this hotel is off the beaten path, I assure you that it is easy to get to and really gets you out of the fray of the Galleria traffic without leaving the neighborhood.\nWe had a great time there- beautiful place with wonderful staff. Would love to go again\nThe hotel room was a lotttt smaller than I thought it would be. We ordered room service and there was a hair in the crab cake! Then it took an hour for us to get any kind of manager or staff member to actually help us. Once we finally talked to someone that could help, Kevin, he was extremely short and unpleasant. When we came down for dinner at the restaurant he didn't address us but talked to every other table around us. Hotel was nice, amenities even nicer but I was disappointed at the services especially given how expensive everything is!\nExcellent hotel - service was beyond anything we have experienced. I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a place to stay in Houston. Location is tremendous and the surrounding area is beautiful!\nBeautiful hotel, but very intimidating!! Hard to figure out where the pools were.\nMy wife and I stayed at the Houstonian for 3 nights in October. The property was lovely and the room was very comfortable. However the fitness facilities are truly amazing. The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities. It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent. My wife also visited the spa and although it was expensive the facilities and service were again of the highest quality.\nWe can to town for a college football game and we a little nervous about the room size some complained about, but found it acceptable. The property is beautiful and the staff was a friendly and helpful as it gets. We will stay here again when we retuen to Houston.\nIt was like a resort in the middle of Houston. The spa, fitness center and pools were a nice touch that enabled us to stay here and be entertained at the same time. Very nice!\nFamily weekend Food was great Grandchildren used pool Family used health Club\nHotel and facilities are beautiful but room was very musty/ mildewy smelling.\nBeautiful hotel at a great value! Amazed at what we paid for a room on the concierge floor that included free daily continental breakfast, early evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and after dinner dessert buffet. The Olivette restaurant was spectacular - had dinner there both nights. Will definitely be my go-to hotel any time I'm in Houston!\nMy family and I like to vist spokane we went on priceline and found that this was the cheapest and it had a indoor pool and and gym We were very pleased the room is clean, smells clean with friendly people and pet friendly. If ur looking for a good night with comfy beds at a good price stay here!\nBudget hotel offers standard amenities and low rates to road-weary travelers. In ShortSince 1946, this Phoenix, Ariz.-based hotel chain has provided guests with comfortable accommodations. Its BestRequests program offers 16 of the most frequently requested services and amenities, including complimentary in-room tea/coffeemakers, hair dryers, iron and ironing boards, free local calls less than 30 minutes and long-distance access. Complimentary toiletries, like toothpaste, razors and sewing kits, are also available upon request. Business travelers will enjoy the computer data ports in each room and photocopying services.\nI asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\nI always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff.\nAdequate but nothing to recommend it.\nWe stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp. It was easy to reach, easy to find and perfect for a short stay. The pool is very large, but almost too warm, and the hot tub is uninviting. We'd just come from a Hilton Garden Inn, which is a very good step up, so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded. We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year, and I'll just say we were determined NOT to stay there again. I'd go back to the Best Western, but I'd suggest you drop the grand from the name.\nGreat service, comfortable hotel. Rug was wet in our room by the window. Otherwise, a super hotel - and a great breakfast!\nGreat service, comfortable hotel. Rug was wet in our room by the window. Otherwise, a super hotel - and a great breakfast!\nexcellent place to stay and food was super...great breakfast and friendly staff\nThe room is comfortable, clean, spacious bathroom and adequate amenities\nVisiting for the night, great breakfast\nWe had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a $14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!\nIf you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs cold cereal, juice. We didn't use the pool, no time for that.\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.\nI am a 75yr old Disabled Vet and had requested 2 bed room on first floor as I have walking disability from service. First thing get sent to 2nd floor King. Nobody even read reservation. Finally got a room in the Zoo section where doors had beware of cat signs posted on doors and hall stunk of cat urine. Did... More\nI always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff.\nHotel was very clean and staff very nice. Beds are only double instead of Queen which makes traveling with two teenage boys not easy. Ordered a cot but really no room to set up had to block bathroom. Great for a two person stay, also free breakfast was for only two people, so had to pay for kids.\nThis is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again.\nThe room was very clean. The staff was very friendly, polite, helpufl and professional.\ngreat time and the breakfast was extra good the rest. in the hotel was also very good\ngreat time and the breakfast was extra good the rest. in the hotel was also very good\nDidn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot are left unlocked. I know, I know, we are in Maine...but still. Clean and well equipped...only complaint was lack of outlets for charging. Very inaccessible. Perfect for a quick stay. Very pleasant desk clerk :)\nDidn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot are left unlocked. I know, I know, we are in Maine...but still. Clean and well equipped...only complaint was lack of outlets for charging. Very inaccessible. Perfect for a quick stay. Very pleasant desk clerk :)\nThey should clean the rugs around the elevators, The room was very clean\nFree breakfast was great dinner not so much. I don't know why I thought sweet potato encrusted haddock sounded good. They also buried it in a white gravy. Gravy does not belong on fish.\nHotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.\nThe hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog. However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the 'included breakfast', which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I've encountered in a while.\nIt's a decent hotel for the price. They provide a solid breakfast, and the rooms are really nice. The only problem is their wifi is spotty if you're in the back of the building.\nIt was an overnighter to get away from some stuff\nStayed overnight for pleasure. Room was clean and well equipped. Pool was great.\nOk overall - we stayed one night with our dogs. We were limited in our choices because of this. Hotel could use updating. Was a little bit noisy in the halls, but overall ok. Did not eat on site but at Governor's across the street.\nI just ran up to the middle of Maine for a one day business trip.
